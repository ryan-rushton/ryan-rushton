### 👋 Hey!

I'm Ryan (he/him), a dad, gamer and software engineer working from Brisbane Australia 🇦🇺.

### 🧑‍🏭 Experience

Primarily I am working as a frontend engineer and have been for a few years, but I am interested in all disciplines. Particular technologies I am familiar with at the moment are React, Typescript, Java and Python. Previously I was full stack and have worked with various things over the years.

### 🥼 Learning

I am (finally) embarking on the machine learning journey 🤖. 

My undergrad background is maths and at the time I wasn't particularly interested in AI. After spending a few years in the industry, I am developing an interest in machine learning due to its math underpinnings and proximity to research.

### 🔒 Fun Fact

I was a locksmith for 10 years before becoming an engineer.
